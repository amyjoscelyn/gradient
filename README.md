# Gradient

A simple premise: change the background colors to change the gradient.

You have 48 color options for top and bottom, each one bringing their own mood to the gradient.  Scroll through the buttons to see all the choices!

When you tap into Rainbow Mode, instead of replacing the current background color, your choice gets added to the gradient's array, making striations in the background for as many colors as you choose.  Wish for something more simple?  Exit out of Rainbow Mode to reset the background to its default gray-white, and with a fresh palette, choose a gradient again!

This is a wonderful tool for developers who need inspiration for a gradient, but don't want to hard-code it all themselves.
